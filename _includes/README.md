# \_includes

This directory is for arbitrary content that can be directly included into layouts or pages.

## Icons

We use SVG icons from various sources, maintained as git submodules. Each of these submodules contain their SVG sources at various, unergonomic locations. To rectify this situation, icons that we intend to use are symlinked into the `_includes/icons` directory for easy access. These symlinks use relative paths.
